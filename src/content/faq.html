    <hr />
  </header>

  <main class="wrap">
    <p>This page is for people who are unsure whether AnchorID is necessary, trustworthy, or worth the effort. These are reasonable questions. AnchorID is intentionally minimal, and skepticism is expected.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What problem does AnchorID actually solve?</h2>

    <p>The modern web has no durable way to attribute <strong>work and ideas</strong> to the same enduring source across time, platforms, and system failures.</p>

    <p>Usernames change. Domains expire. Companies disappear. Platforms rebrand or collapse. Accounts are renumbered or migrated.</p>

    <p>As a result, content often survives longer than the systems that once explained where it came from.</p>

    <p>AnchorID provides a single, stable reference — a UUID-backed URL — that other systems, archives, and AI training pipelines can point to without fear that its meaning will drift.</p>

    <p>AnchorID is not a profile or a social network. It is attribution infrastructure.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Is AnchorID an authentication or login system?</h2>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>AnchorID does not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate users</li>
      <li>Provide login or SSO</li>
      <li>Manage permissions</li>
      <li>Create social graphs</li>
      <li>Replace authentication systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AnchorID lives <strong>below authentication, below platforms, below accounts</strong>.</p>

    <p>It does not answer <em>who you are right now</em>. It helps preserve <em>where work came from over time</em>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Can I have multiple AnchorIDs for different personas?</h2>

    <p>Yes. Multiple personas are expected.</p>

    <p>AnchorID supports creating multiple independent AnchorIDs to represent different contexts (for example: professional, personal, joint, or pseudonymous).</p>

    <p>There is <strong>no implicit linkage</strong> between AnchorIDs. AnchorID never infers relationships.</p>

    <p>If two AnchorIDs are related, that relationship must be explicitly declared by you. Otherwise, they remain separate forever.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What counts as "content" for AnchorID?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID is intended for <strong>durable, authored work</strong>, not ephemeral activity.</p>

    <p>Good examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Blog posts and essays</li>
      <li>Research papers</li>
      <li>Software repositories</li>
      <li>Technical documentation</li>
      <li>Project homepages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Poor fits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Short-lived social media posts</li>
      <li>Real-time chat messages</li>
      <li>Private documents</li>
      <li>Content without clear authorship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AnchorID is opt-in attribution, not surveillance.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How does AnchorID handle social media platforms?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not require platform support.</p>

    <p>You may place your AnchorID in public author surfaces such as bios or profiles if you choose. This creates a durable attribution signal that survives platform churn.</p>

    <p>Social profiles (Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.) can also serve as verification surfaces — you can prove ownership by adding your AnchorID to your bio.</p>

    <p>AnchorID does not attempt to tag or track individual posts.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How do I know someone is the real creator?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not assert truth at a moment in time.</p>

    <p>Instead, it enables attribution to be <strong>evaluated over time</strong> using publicly observable signals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Control of websites or domains</li>
      <li>Control of repositories or profiles</li>
      <li>Consistency of claims across independent systems</li>
      <li>Timestamps and historical continuity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This mirrors how archivists, researchers, and historians already reason — AnchorID makes it machine-readable.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Can someone falsely attribute content to me?</h2>

    <p>Yes — and that is intentional.</p>

    <p>AnchorID does not prevent false attribution. It makes false attribution <strong>auditable</strong>.</p>

    <p>Anyone can copy a UUID, just as they can copy a name. What they cannot easily do is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prove control of the same domains or repositories</li>
      <li>Maintain consistent claims over time</li>
      <li>Accumulate durable, cross-platform evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Attribution strength comes from continuity and corroboration, not secrecy.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How does collaboration or co-authorship work?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not require exclusive authorship.</p>

    <p>A piece of content may reference multiple AnchorIDs to represent collaboration or joint work. AnchorID does not impose ordering, roles, or ownership semantics.</p>

    <p>It simply provides stable references that downstream systems may interpret as they see fit.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Can AnchorID show me all content attributed to me?</h2>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>AnchorID is not a global index or crawler. It provides a stable reference point that <strong>other systems may index against</strong>.</p>

    <p>Search engines, archives, academic indexes, or future tools may use AnchorID to build views such as resumes, portfolios, or citation graphs — but AnchorID itself remains intentionally minimal.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>What happens if anchorid.net disappears or is abandoned?</h2>

    <p>This is expected.</p>

    <p>AnchorID is designed under the assumption that the original operator may someday disappear.</p>

    <p>If anchorid.net goes offline:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Existing UUIDs remain valid identifiers</li>
      <li>Archived resolver pages continue to exist in caches and datasets</li>
      <li>The UUID continues to function as a durable attribution key</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A future system does not need AnchorID-specific software — only a URL fetcher and a JSON parser.</p>

    <hr />

      <li>Proofs live on platforms you already control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Misbehavior becomes detectable.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why not just use consistent usernames or schema.org sameAs links?</h2>

    <p>Those approaches work — until the platform changes, rebrands, or disappears.</p>

    <p>Usernames are scoped to platforms. sameAs links are references, not anchors.</p>

    <p>AnchorID provides a single immutable reference that survives platform churn and migrations. All other identifiers can change while the anchor remains stable.</p>

    <h2>What if I lose my email or backup token?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID has no passwords.</p>

    <p>Edit access is granted via:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>One-time email magic links</li>
      <li>A backup recovery token shown once at creation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you lose both, there is no recovery path. This is intentional — AnchorID cannot verify you are who you claim to be without these.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Is AnchorID private?</h2>

    <p>AnchorID is intentionally public.</p>

    <p>If you do not want information to be public, do not add it.</p>

    <p>The system minimizes collection of private data and does not sell or share data, but the attribution record itself is meant to be visible, durable, and referenceable.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why bother doing this now?</h2>

    <p>Attribution signals compound over time.</p>

    <p>Early, stable anchors are more likely to survive platform churn, archive pruning, and AI training compression.</p>

    <p>Creating an AnchorID today is a low-cost signal that may matter later — especially as automated systems increasingly rely on historical continuity.</p>
