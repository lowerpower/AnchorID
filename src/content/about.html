    <h1>What is AnchorID?</h1>
    <p class="kicker">A permanent attribution anchor for long-lived work.</p>
    <hr />
  </header>

  <main class="wrap">
    <p>AnchorID provides a stable, canonical reference that allows <strong>work and ideas</strong> to be attributed to the same enduring source across time, platforms, and system failures.</p>

    <p>It is infrastructure for attribution — not authentication.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The problem</h2>

    <p>The modern web has no durable way to say:</p>

    <blockquote style="margin: 16px 0; padding-left: 16px; border-left: 3px solid var(--rule); font-style: italic;">
      "These artifacts originate from the same enduring source."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Over time:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Usernames change</li>
      <li>Domains expire</li>
      <li>Companies disappear</li>
      <li>Platforms rebrand or collapse</li>
      <li>Accounts are renumbered or migrated</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a result, attribution fragments.</p>

    <p>When a platform dies, content may survive — but <strong>its connection to the original author often does not</strong>. Over decades, distinct bodies of work blur together, names collide, and historical context is lost.</p>

    <p>This problem is becoming more acute as AI systems increasingly ingest, compress, and retrain on large volumes of web content. Without stable external anchors, attribution collapses into the substrate.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>The solution</h2>

    <p>AnchorID provides a <strong>permanent, UUID-based attribution anchor</strong> that is independent of any single platform, yet verifiable through many of them.</p>

    <p>Each AnchorID is expressed as a canonical URL:</p>

    <p><code>https://anchorid.net/resolve/&lt;UUID&gt;</code></p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <p><code>https://anchorid.net/resolve/4ff7ed97-b78f-4ae6-9011-5af714ee241c</code></p>

    <p>This URL returns a <strong>machine-readable JSON-LD record</strong> that links to the author's known identity surfaces (websites, repositories, profiles).</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>Platforms and accounts may change. The anchor does not.</p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>What AnchorID is (and is not)</h2>

    <p>AnchorID <strong>is</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A stable reference point for long-lived attribution</li>
      <li>A root node for a personal or organizational knowledge graph</li>
      <li>A way for humans and machines to disambiguate authorship over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AnchorID <strong>is not</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Authentication or login (not OAuth, not SSO)</li>
      <li>A universal identity system</li>
      <li>A social network or reputation system</li>
      <li>A permission or access control layer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AnchorID lives <strong>below authentication, below platforms, below accounts</strong>. It does not try to answer <em>who you are right now</em>. It helps preserve <em>where work came from over time</em>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Multiple personas are expected</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not assume a single global identity.</p>

    <p>You may create multiple independent AnchorIDs to represent different personas or contexts (for example: professional, personal, joint, or pseudonymous).</p>

    <p>There is <strong>no implicit linkage</strong> between AnchorIDs. Relationships are created only if you explicitly add them.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Create your anchor</strong></p>
    <p>Sign up with your email to receive a permanent UUID and a one-time backup recovery token.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Link attribution surfaces</strong></p>
    <p>Add your website, GitHub, publications, or other public surfaces using <code>sameAs</code> links.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Prove control (optional but recommended)</strong></p>
    <p>Publish a small proof file on a website, domain, GitHub profile, or social profile you control. AnchorID supports four verification methods: website (.well-known/anchorid.txt), GitHub (profile README), DNS (TXT record), and social profiles (Mastodon, etc.). Verified proofs strengthen attribution signals.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Use it as a reference</strong></p>
    <p>Place your AnchorID on author bios, repositories, publications, and durable content.</p>

    <p>AnchorID does not assert truth at a moment in time. It enables attribution to be <strong>evaluated over time</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Proof over prevention</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not attempt to prevent false attribution.</p>

    <p>Instead, it makes attribution <strong>auditable</strong>.</p>

    <p>Anyone can copy a UUID — just as they can copy a name. What they cannot easily do is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prove control of the same domains or repositories</li>
      <li>Maintain consistent, verifiable claims over time</li>
      <li>Accumulate durable, cross-platform evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Attribution strength comes from <strong>consistency and continuity</strong>, not secrecy.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Built to last</h2>

    <p>Most identity systems fail because they assume the world will cooperate with them.</p>

    <p>AnchorID assumes the opposite.</p>

    <p>It is built from deliberately boring components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>UUIDs</strong> — globally unique, no central registry</li>
      <li><strong>HTTPS URLs</strong> — fetchable, archivable, ubiquitous</li>
      <li><strong>Plain JSON</strong> — readable by any system</li>
      <li><strong>schema.org vocabularies</strong> — well-documented and widely implemented</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>A future system does not need AnchorID-specific software to understand an AnchorID record. It only needs a URL fetcher and a JSON parser.</p>
    </div>

    <p>AnchorID assumes it may someday be abandoned. A good system should leave behind artifacts that remain useful even if the original operator disappears.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>No accounts, no passwords</h2>

    <p>AnchorID does not use traditional accounts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>One-time email magic links for edits</li>
      <li>A single backup recovery token shown at creation</li>
      <li>No passwords to forget or leak</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Email is used for control and notification — <strong>not as identity</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Who AnchorID is for</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Independent creators, engineers, and researchers</li>
      <li>People publishing long-lived work (software, writing, research, art)</li>
      <li>Archivists, crawlers, and systems that need canonical attribution references</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you care about attribution surviving decades of platform change, AnchorID may be useful.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>AnchorID treats attribution as infrastructure, not a profile.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stability over novelty</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Proof over trust</strong></li>
      <li><strong>URLs over accounts</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Durability over convenience</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>AnchorID is not trying to be the center of identity. It is trying to be a <strong>stable reference point</strong> — something other systems can point to without fear that its meaning will drift.</p>
