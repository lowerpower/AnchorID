# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

AnchorID is a minimalist attribution service. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. 

Instead, please send an email to: **[anchorid @ its domain]**

I will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. 

## Supported Versions

Only the current version running on `anchorid.net` (the `main` branch of this repository) is supported for security updates.

## Philosophy

AnchorID optimizes for **auditability** and **persistence**. Our security model relies on public proofs and decentralized verification. For more details, see our [Threat Model](docs/threat-model.md).
